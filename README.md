# Semi-supervised clustering

This is a minimal example of how to do semi-supervised clustering as described in the paper:
[Data-driven semi-supervised clustering for oil prediction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098300420306543)

## Installation
The code is made for matlab 2021 and might not work for earlier versions of matlab. 

## Run
To run a simple example and generate the above figure, run the script: run_clustering.m

This code will generate an example as illustrated below:
![Alt text](figures/fig1.png?raw=true "Input")
And cluster it into something similar to this:
![Alt text](figures/fig2.png?raw=true "Output")
